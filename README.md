Project: Capstone
=================

About
-----
From Udacity:
> In the capstone project, each project is unique to the student. Youâ€™ll
build a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application for different deployment
strategies. Students define the scope of the project and select the right
deployment strategy based on different business requirements.

The project code I chose to build my CI/CD pipeline around is a median
microservice. It is a REST api that allows the submission of integer values
and the asynchronous retrieval of a median for the set of submitted integers
over a certain interval (one minute by default). Among other technologies, it
leverages Redis and RabbitMQ.
